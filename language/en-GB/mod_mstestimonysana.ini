MOD_MSTESTIMONSANA_LA_SANACION='"The Womb Healing helped me to unblock my energy flow and allowed me to reconnect with my cycle again. After many months of not having my period, I menstruated again two weeks after the session. Mariela taught me about the archetypes of the menstrual cycle and how important it is to be in balance with your body and more specifically with your uterus. She gave me the tools to understand myself better. She helped me to raise awareness and awaken the love for my femininity.”'
MOD_MSTESTIMONSANA_LA_TERAPIA='“Menstrual therapy was not limited to physical issues, it was something much more profound. Being able to find myself at different moments of growth in my life gave me the possibility to heal some issues that had remained unsolved for too long. The therapy also helped me to become friends with my blood and understand the different women living within me.”'
MOD_MSTESTIMONSANA_COMENCE_A_T='“I started taking yoga classes for the first time about six months ago, it has been an incredible mental and physical exercise. Mariela teaches with serenity and understanding, she gives you exercises that allow you a different connection with your body and your thoughts, fundamental in the times of anxiety and uncertainty that we live through now. Thanks to the way she guides the movements, each class is unique, it broadens my perceptions. I fully recommend taking her classes.”'
